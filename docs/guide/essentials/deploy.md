# Build & Deploy

## Build

When projects are completed, you can build your application only run one command:

```bash
# build for production environment
npm run build:prod

# build for stage environment
npm run build:stage
```

After the build package is successful, the `dist` folder will be generated in the root directory, which is to build a packaged file, usually static files such as `***.js`, `***.css`, `index.html`, etc. .

If you need a custom build, such as specifying the dist directory, you need to configure it through `outputDir` in [config](https://github.com/PanJiaChen/vue-element-admin/blob/master/vue.config.js).

### Environmental variables

The configuration of all test environments or formal environment variables is in the `.env.xxxx` file such as [.env.development](https://github.com/PanJiaChen/vue-element-admin/blob/master/.env.development).

They all inject into the global context via the `webpack.DefinePlugin` plug-ins.

::: tip note! ! !
Environment variables must start with `VUE_APP_`. Such as: `VUE_APP_API`, `VUE_APP_TITLE`

You can access them in your application code:

```js
console.log(process.env.VUE_APP_xxxx)
```

### Analyze the build file size

If your build file is large, you can optimize your code by building and analyzing the size distribution of dependent modules using the `webpack-bundle-analyzer`.

```bash
npm run preview -- --report
```

After running you can see the specific size distribution at [http://localhost:9526/report.html](http://localhost:9526/report.html)

::: tip
It is recommended to use gzip, after using the volume will be only the original 1/3 or so. You can also use lazy loading or Code Splitting.

## Publish

For publishing, you only have to publish the resulting static file after build, which is usually the static file in the `dist` folder, to your cdn or static server. Note that the `index.html` usually will be an entry page for your backend service. You may need to change the page's import path after determining static for JS and css.

::: tip
In deployment may find that the resource path is wrong, just modify the `@/config/index.js` file resource path.
:::

```js
// changes configure depending on your own path
publicPath: './'
```

### Router & Server

In vue-element-admin, the front-end routing uses `vue-router`, so you have two options:`browserHistory` and `hashHistory`.

Simply speaking, the difference between them is the deal with routing. `hashHistory` is processed by the path following `#`, front-end routing management through [HTML 5 History](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History_API), and `browserHistory` is similar to our usual page access path, and with not `#`, but must through the server's configuration.

This project uses `hashHistory` by default, so if you have`#`in your url and you want to get rid of it, you need to switch to`browserHistory`.

Modify `src/router/index.js` modeã€‚

```js
export default new Router({
  // mode: 'history' // Need backend support
})
```
